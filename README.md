# Computer-Graphics---Simulating-a-Roller-Coaster

## Overview
This project implements a roller coaster simulation using Catmull-Rom splines along with OpenGL core profile shader-based lighting and texture mapping. The simulation features a first-person view that allows users to "ride" the roller coaster in an immersive environment, showcasing realistic spline-based track rendering, Phong shading, and texture mapping.

## Key Features
- **Catmull-Rom Splines**: Smooth, continuous tracks generated using Catmull-Rom splines. The track is defined by a series of control points, creating an elaborate curve for the coaster.
- **Texture Mapping**: Ground texture mapping using a dedicated shader, enhancing the visual realism of the environment.
- **Phong Shading**: Per-pixel lighting on the roller coaster rails, enhancing the detail and immersion of the simulation.
- **First-Person View**: A camera follows the track, allowing users to experience the ride as if they are on the coaster. The camera orientation is continuously updated to align with the track's tangent vector.
- **Track Cross-Section**: A customizable cross-section rendering for the rails, such as square or circular, giving the coaster a more realistic look.

## Implementation Details

### Spline Rendering
- The roller coaster track is created by evaluating Catmull-Rom splines, defined by four control points and a parameter `u` that varies from 0 to 1. 
- Consecutive splines are drawn by connecting points using OpenGL's `GL_LINES`. 
- A stationary camera setup allows viewing from various angles using keyboard and mouse controls.

### First-Person Camera Movement
- The camera moves at a constant speed along the spline, facing forward based on the spline's tangent vector, and includes a continuously adjusted "up" vector for realistic motion.

### Rail Cross-Section
- The track is rendered as a tube using tangent, normal, and binormal vectors, with customizable cross-section shapes. Vertex colors correspond to the triangle normals, enhancing the visual shading.

### Ground Plane
- The ground plane is rendered using a separate texture shader, distinct from the roller coaster's shading pipeline. This separation allows multiple shaders to coexist in the scene.

### Phong Shading
- Phong shading is used to render the roller coaster rails, providing per-pixel lighting that enhances the detail and depth of the rendered objects.

## Technical Specifications
- **OpenGL Version**: Core profile, version 3.2 or higher, with shader-based rendering only.
- **Shaders**: Implemented two separate shadersâ€”one for texture mapping (ground) and one for Phong shading (rails).
- **Performance**: Designed to run interactively at frame rates above 15fps at 1280x720 resolution.

## Animation
- The project includes an animation sequence that captures the coaster's motion through a series of JPEG images. The animation demonstrates the roller coaster's design and the simulation's immersive elements.

## How to Run This Project
1. Compile the program using the provided Makefile or your preferred setup.
